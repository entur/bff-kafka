Put the Google Service Account Keys json files for entur-staging and entur-dev in this folder (serviceAccountKeys).

Do NOT check in files (they are by default ignored by git).

Files must be named

`entur-<environment>.json`

for example `entur-staging.json`

For Entur employees, see the following page for more detailed setup instructions:
